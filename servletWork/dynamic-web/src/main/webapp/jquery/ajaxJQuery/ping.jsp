Most of the surviving super tuskers, also known as “great tuskers,” are found in southern Kenya, where Italian-born photographer Federico Veronesi has spent years tracking and photographing them. His new book, “Walk the Earth,” the culmination of years of work in Kenya and beyond, pays tribute to the elephants he calls “the last witnesses of a world before humans took over the Earth.”
As a child growing up in Italy, Veronesi was captivated by African wildlife. That fascination led him to Kenya, where he eventually settled and began photographing the animals he had admired for so long.
“Photography is almost like a medium through which I get to stay among the animals and express my love for them,” said Veronesi.
